## Description
MakerDAO is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum 
blockchain that allows individuals to create and manage the DAI stablecoin, 
which is pegged to the value of the US dollar. MakerDAO uses a system of 
smart contracts to manage the creation and redemption of DAI tokens, which 
can be used for a variety of purposes, such as payments, trading, and investment.

One of the key features of MakerDAO is its collateralized debt position (CDP) 
system, which allows users to lock up their digital assets as collateral in order 
to generate DAI stablecoins. This creates a decentralized lending system that is 
independent of traditional financial intermediaries and allows users to access 
liquidity without having to sell their assets.

### Metrics related to MakerDAO protocol:
