## Description
[Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) is a decentralized borrowing protocol operating on the Ethereum 
blockchain. It allows users to borrow a stablecoin, LUSD, against their Ethereum (ETH) collateral.

It stands out from other borrowing protocols because of its unique approach to interest calculation 
for loans. Liquity applies a small, fixed fee for borrowing LUSD, rather than subjecting users to 
highly fluctuating interest rates.

Aside from the collateral, the loans are backed by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and 
by other borrowers collectively serving as a safety net.
