Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols are blockchain-based 
platforms that allow individuals to lend and borrow digital assets without the need 
for traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks. These protocols utilize 
smart contracts, which are self-executing code on a blockchain, to automate the 
lending and borrowing process and enforce the terms of the agreement between parties.

On these DeFi platforms, users can lend their digital assets to other users and earn 
interest on their deposits. Conversely, borrowers can use these digital assets as 
collateral to obtain loans in the form of stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. 
DeFi lending and borrowing protocols typically offer more flexibility, accessibility, 
and transparency than traditional finance and allow users to participate in the 
global financial system without the need for intermediaries or extensive paperwork. 
However, they also carry additional risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities 
and market volatility.
