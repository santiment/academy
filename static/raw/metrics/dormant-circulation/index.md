## Definition

Dormant Circulation shows number of unique coins/tokens transacted on a given day that
have not been moved for big amount of time.

Examples:

- `dormant_circulation_10y` - Shows how many coins/tokens that have not been moved
  for more than 10 years were transacted during a day. This is useful for spotting
  when really old Bitcoins move.
- `dormant_circulation_90d` - Shows how many coins/tokens that have not been moved
  for more than 90 days were transacted during a day. This is the smallest interval
  supported for that metric.

There are also dormant circulation metrics `dormant_circulation_usd_*` that represent the USD value of all 
unique coins or tokens that were transacted within a single day that have not been moved for some time.
