## Renamed Metrics

<Notebox type="note">
Renamed metrics are those that have undergone a name change within our system, reflecting updates to terminology or standardization efforts. These metrics remain actively supported for analysis and reporting but may now be referred to by a different name than previously used. It's important for users to be aware of these changes to ensure clarity and consistency in their analytical processes. While the underlying data and calculation methods for renamed metrics remain unchanged, their updated names help align our reporting practices with industry standards and best practices. Relying on renamed metrics allows for smoother communication and interpretation of analytical results across teams and stakeholders.

## Why Do We Rename Metrics?

Metrics undergo renaming for several reasons, driven by our commitment to enhancing clarity, consistency, and alignment with industry standards. Here's why certain metrics may be renamed:

1. **Standardization Efforts**: In response to evolving industry norms or best practices, we periodically update our metric terminology to align with widely accepted standards. Renaming metrics ensures consistency in communication and facilitates interoperability with external partners or industry peers, enhancing the clarity and accessibility of our analytical outputs.

2. **Clarification of Concepts**: Renaming metrics may also serve to clarify their underlying concepts or methodologies, reducing ambiguity and improving understanding among users. By adopting more intuitive or descriptive names, we enhance the interpretability of metrics and facilitate more informed decision-making based on our analytical insights.

3. **Alignment with User Feedback**: Feedback from users and stakeholders often informs our decisions to rename metrics, addressing concerns or confusion surrounding existing terminology. By incorporating user input, we strive to optimize the usability and relevance of our metrics, ensuring that they effectively meet the needs of our diverse user base.

## Benefits of Renaming Metrics

While metrics undergo name changes, their underlying definitions and calculations remain consistent, ensuring continuity and comparability in our analytical outputs. By staying informed about renamed metrics and updating documentation and training materials accordingly, users can seamlessly transition to using the updated terminology without disrupting their analytical workflows. Embracing renamed metrics supports our commitment to clarity, consistency, and alignment with industry standards, enhancing the effectiveness and relevance of our data analysis processes.
