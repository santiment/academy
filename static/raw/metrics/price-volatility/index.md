## Description
Price volatility is used to describe price fluctuations of an asset. 

If we use $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to denote mean and standard deviation of asset prices, 
then we define **Price Volatility** as:

$$
volatility(assetPrice) = \frac{\sigma(assetPrice)}{\mu(assetPrice)}
$$

Price volatility metrics are available for 4 different time periods
* `price_volatility_1d` - Price volatility for the last day
* `price_volatility_1w` - Price volatility for the last 7 days
* `price_volatility_2w` - Price volatility for the last 14 days
* `price_volatility_4w` - Price volatility for the last 28 days

Examples of use cases:
* Traders seek volatile assets because they move more quickly and have larger price changes. Those price changes are both upward and downward. Keeping this in mind, a trader needs effective risk management in order to trade volatile assets profitably.
* On the other hand, some traders seek exposure to the assets that are the least volatile, and they might use this metric to identify those assets.
