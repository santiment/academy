## Definition

Age Consumed shows the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date,
multiplied by the time since they last moved.

Spikes on the graph signal a large amount of tokens moving after being idle for
an extended period of time.

One potential use case for this metric is identifying when big market players
exit the project post ICO.

Here's the Token Age Consumed graph for [Golem](https://golem.network/), an
ERC-20 project that lets you rent other people's computing power.

We can easily spot several significant spikes over time: each could be a large
early investor selling their tokens, which commonly results in a parallel price
decline.
