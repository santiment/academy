## On-Chain Latency

In order to compute on-chain data, a number block confirmations are required
before fetching the data for a given block. Measured in time:

- Bitcoin - Around 30 minutes
- Ethereum - Around 5 minutes
- Bitcoin Cash - Around 5 minutes
- Litecoin - Around 5 minutes
- Binance Chain - Around 5 minutes
- XRPL Chain - Around 5 minutes

After the block is considered confirmed and its data is fetched, the data
processing can take anywhere from a few minutes to few hours. The upper limits
are:

- For 5-minute interval metrics processing the data can take up to 20 minutes
  most
- For daily metrics processing the data can take up to 2 hours

## Social Data Latency

Each one of the social data source:

- Telegram
- Reddit
- Bitcointalk
- Twitter
- 4chan
- Youtube Videos

is being processed separately and usually doesn't take longer than 1 minute.

The emerging trends are computed once per hour so they become available a few
minutes after every round hour.

The data for assets is usually computed and it takes 20-40 minutes to compute.

Data for text terms is computed on-the-fly on the raw data and can be accessed as soon as the
text messages are stored in our database.

## Funding Rates Latency

The funding rates are updated every 15 minutes

## Price Latency

The prices are updated every 5 minutes

## Development Activity Latency

The development activity metrics are updated every 1 hour with max delays of 6
hours

## Daily Metrics Latency

The daily metrics have one value per day. The value is finalized at least 1 hour
after the day is over, using the UTC timezone.
