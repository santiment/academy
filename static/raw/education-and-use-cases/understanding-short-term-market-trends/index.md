## Overview

This handbook aims to help traders and investors identify market tops. Itâ€™s
most useful for small to mid-cap coins driven by momentum and social
narratives.

&nbsp;

For the purpose, we will use a layout with four charts with key indicators. We
will use SHIB as a proxy.

&nbsp;

Key indicators are:

- Network activity (address activity and network growth)
- Social metrics (volume and sentiment)
- Valuation metrics (MVRV)
- Derivative metrics (funding rate and open interest)

&nbsp;

Open this layout with four charts and letâ€™s dive in.

## Network Activity

Chart 1 of the layout combines address activity and network growth metrics.
The idea is to gauge if the price rise is supported by the network metrics
rise. If it isnâ€™t - good chance for a top.

<Notebox type="arrowRight">
Active Addresses 24h - the number of distinct addresses that participated in a
transfer for the given asset in the past 24 hours window.

Network Growth - the number of new addresses that transferred a given coin for
the first time.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="dart">
Assess if price rises are supported by network activity.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="brain">
If network metrics don't rise with the price, it often signals a potential
market top.
</Notebox>

## Social Metrics

Same idea applies to social volume and sentiment metrics on Chart 2 of the layout. Those metrics are usually the strongest mid-trend. When they start slumping but the price still pushes higher - that indicates narrative weakening and momentum exhaustion, which is a good signal to get out.

<Notebox type="arrowRight">
Social Volume - the total number of social media messages that contain the
given search term at least once.

Weighted Sentiment - a numeric representation of social context around a coin.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="dart">
ðŸŽ¯ Assess mid-trend strength through social metrics.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="brain">
A decline in social volume and sentiment despite rising prices indicates
weakening narratives and momentum, hence an exit signal.
</Notebox>

## Valuation Metrics

Chart 3 of the layout shows Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio metrics. The same approach applies as in long-term trend analysis, just on a much shorter timeframe.

![noborder](./valuation_metrics.png)

<Notebox type="arrowRight">
 MVRV - an asset's market capitalization divided by realized capitalization.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="dart">
Observe divergences between MVRV and price by analyzing MVRVs for different
timeframes based on coin movements.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="brain">
Rising Realized Value indicates "greed," often leading to a downward trend.

Dropping Realized Value indicates losses, causing MVRV to diverge upwards.

Divergences reveal market sentiment and potential price movements.
</Notebox>

## Derivatives Metrics
On Chart 4 of the layout we look at funding rate and open interest metrics.
They allow us to analyse the derivatives market of a coin. Increase of open
interest and high funding while price staying seemingly slat might indicate
insiders positioning for an upcoming catalyst event.

![noborder](./derivative_metrics.png)

<Notebox type="arrowRight">
Total Funding Rates Aggregated by Asset - the aggregation of all funding rates
by open interest for a given asset.

Open Interest in coins - the sum of open interests of all contracts for a given
asset.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="dart">
Analyse the derivatives market for potential insider activity.
</Notebox>

<Notebox type="brain">
Rising open interest and high funding rates with stable prices indicate insider
positioning for upcoming catalyst events.
</Notebox>

All of these metrics will help you better spot trend reversals early and to
identify potential infliction points.
