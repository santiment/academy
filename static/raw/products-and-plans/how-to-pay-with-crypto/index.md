## Pay With ETH or DAI

When it comes to cryptocurrency tools and services, having convenient and alternative methods to exchange them outside of traditional fiat options is essential for working toward mass adoption. This is why we offer our users the ability to pay with different cryptocurrencies to conveniently exchange quickly and easily for access to our services.

To make a payment with crypto, you can choose to use `Ethereum (ETH)`, `Dai (DAI)`, or other Ethereum-based stablecoins for any of our services.

*To make use of your SAN tokens while also getting a hefty discount, please check [further below](/products-and-plans/how-to-pay-with-crypto/#burning-san-tokens-to-make-payments).*

To make a payment with ETH or DAI, simply send either form of crypto to this address:

**0x1F3dF0b8390BB8e9e322972C5e75583E87608Ec2**

You can input:

`pay.santiment.eth`

in the send address as an alias to this respective payment address (see below screenshot).

For any assistance on making a payment, you can contact our team at [support@santiment.net](mailto:support@santiment.net) and it will auto-forward your conversation to our Intercom system for quick help.

> **Note:** If you opt to pay with ETH or DAI, any service is available to pay with this method.

## Burning SAN Tokens for Subscription Payments

SAN token holders can utilize a token burning method to make use of their SAN holdings for subscription payments, instead of paying the regular way. If you're unfamiliar with token burning, it's the act of intentionally sending tokens to an invalid address to permanently remove them from the available circulating supply.

Burning SAN tokens provides a substantial discount incentive for our users who choose to take advantage of this opportunity. It allows you to burn SAN tokens at a rate of twice the current market rate, which equates to a 50% discount compared to regular payments. Additionally, the total supply of SAN shrinks with every burn, benefiting all SAN holders.

Please be aware of the following restrictions:

> - Paying via SAN burn is limited to Sanbase subscriptions and is not available for SanAPI subscriptions.
> - SAN burn is not available for residents of the Swiss Confederation due to tax regulations.
> - SAN burn can only be applied to yearly base subscription prices. No other discounts are applicable when using SAN burn.

Thank you for your understanding.

If you are ready to burn SAN for a yearly Sanbase Pro subscription, please contact us at [support@santiment.net](mailto:support@santiment.net) and we will be happy to guide you through the process.

## Providing SAN Uniswap Liquidity

Another way to gain Pro access to Sanbase is by providing liquidity for the SAN/ETH trading pair on Uniswap V2! As long as you provide 3000+ SAN to our Uniswap V2 pool (and the corresponding amount of ETH), you will receive FREE access to Sanbase Pro, including all our metrics, new templates, and daily market insights!

You can add liquidity to the SAN<->ETH pool here: [https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0x7C5A0CE9267ED19B22F8cae653F198e3E8daf098](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0x7C5A0CE9267ED19B22F8cae653F198e3E8daf098).

As soon as you hold the LP tokens in your wallet and connect it to your account or log in with it, you will automatically receive a Pro subscription within one hour. ðŸ’—
