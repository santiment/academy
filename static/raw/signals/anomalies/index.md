## Definition

An **Anomalie** is a signal that indicates the real value of the metric doesn't fall in the predicted interval.

We predict confidence intervals for every metric and every asset using [fbprophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) (written by facebook).
Signals can be useful because there are many assets and metrics out there, so it's hard to view all of this data.
After that we compare predicted lower and upper values to actual value and if it doesn't fall in the interval then we publish it as a signal.
