To use SAN tokens with our platform, you need to have them in a MetaMask wallet or a wallet supported by MetaMask (such as Trezor or Ledger). We will outline the three necessary steps to accomplish this.

## Step 1: Install and Set Up MetaMask

For instructions on how to install and set up MetaMask, visit [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io). You will need an Ethereum address to hold SAN tokens and interact with the Santiment platform. You can create a new wallet in MetaMask, import an existing wallet, or connect MetaMask to a hardware wallet like **Ledger** or **Trezor**.

## Step 2: Add Funds to MetaMask Wallet

To acquire SAN tokens, you will need to swap them for ETH or another ERC20 token. You can obtain ETH from a centralized exchange like [Bitfinex](https://bitfinex.com/t/ETH:USD) and then transfer it to your MetaMask wallet.

## Step 3: Swap ETH to SAN Tokens

You can use decentralized exchanges or decentralized exchange aggregators to swap ETH or another ERC20 token for SAN tokens. These platforms operate in a similar manner. First, connect your Metamask wallet, and then proceed to swap ETH for SAN tokens.

### Decentralized Exchanges

#### Uniswap

The SAN token is also available on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x7C5A0CE9267ED19B22F8cae653F198e3E8daf098&inputCurrency=ETH) at competitive rates.

#### Kyber

San tokens are also available on [Kyber](https://kyber.network/) via [Kyber Swap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/ethereum/eth-to-san). If you donâ€™t have any crypto, you may get it on [Kyber](https://kyberswap.com/buy-crypto) using your credit card.

#### Bancor

The SAN token is available on [Bancor](https://app.bancor.network/trade?from=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&to=0x7C5A0CE9267ED19B22F8cae653F198e3E8daf098). Once you connect your Metamask, you can [purchase ETH on Bancor](https://app.bancor.network/fiat) using your credit card and then swap it for SAN Tokens.

### Decentralized Exchange Aggregators

You can use a decentralized exchange aggregator like [ParaSwap.io](http://app.paraswap.io/) or [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/) to acquire SAN tokens. Using an aggregator may sometimes provide a better price than using an exchange directly.

## What to do next?

Now, simply [log in with a MetaMask](https://app.santiment.net/login) account that holds SAN tokens. Alternatively, you can [connect your Sanbase account](/san-tokens/connect-a-wallet-to-the-sanbase-account) with your MetaMask wallet in the settings.

We'll detect the SAN tokens you're holding and grant you access to our discounts, based on the amount of tokens you hold.
