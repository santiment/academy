For us, it is incredibly easy to fetch various data sets like on-chain, social media and development info directly to Bitfinex through their unified API and across different blockchains. The Santiment team has worked hard on creating a stable, reliable and all-inclusive data source for crypto, and they’ve more than delivered.",

Using a combination of pricing and blockchain data via Santiment’s API, I was quickly able to develop hybrid trade signals that have proven highly reliable, effective and - most importantly - profitable.",

The GraphiQL API is great if you want very specific data for your research or pipeline implementations.
