trading decisions? Santiment is a powerful platform that goes beyond basic
price charts, providing you with the tools and data to understand the
underlying forces driving the market. This article summarizes the key
features and benefits of Santiment, helping you understand how it can enhance
your trading decisions.

## The Santiment Advantage: Data-Driven Insights

Santiment's core philosophy is to move beyond price action and delve into the
behavioral patterns of market participants. Instead of relying solely on price
data, which can be easily manipulated, Santiment focuses on:

- **On-Chain Metrics**: Analyzing transactions on the blockchain to understand
  the actual movement and usage of cryptocurrencies.
- **Social Sentiment:** Tracking discussions and sentiment across social media
  to gauge the prevailing mood and trends.
- **Key Stakeholder Activity:** Monitoring the actions of large holders
  ("whales" and "sharks") to identify potential market shifts.

This comprehensive approach provides a more holistic view of the market,
allowing you to make more informed decisions.

## Practical Use Cases

### Identifying Market Tops and Bottoms

Santiment's tools can help you identify potential market turning points:

#### Tops

- [Social Volume Spikes](/getting-started/for-traders/#spot-tops-and-exit-opportunities):
  Extreme spikes in social volume during a rally can indicate a local top,
  especially for smaller-cap coins.
- [Negative Sentiment](/metrics/sentiment-metrics/#what-is-sentiment):
  When the crowd is overly bullish, it can be a sign that a top is near.
  Santiment's [weighted sentiment
  metric](/metrics/sentiment-metrics/weighted-sentiment-metrics/#definition)
  can help identify these situations.

#### Bottoms

- [Contrarian Approach](/getting-started/for-traders/#spot-bottoms-and-entry-opportunities):
  Santiment's research suggests that the market often moves in the opposite
  direction of the crowd's expectations. Buying when the crowd is bearish can
  be a profitable strategy.
- [Network Activity](/education-and-use-cases/understanding-short-term-market-trends/#network-activity):
  Increased network activity, even during a price downturn, can indicate a
  potential bottom.

#### Monitoring Volatility

Metrics like [Token Age Consumed](/education-and-use-cases/timing-market-volatility-with-token-age-consumed/)
alert you to potential trend reversals by tracking the movement of previously
idle coins.

#### Understanding Real-World Utility

[Transaction volume](/education-and-use-cases/trading-and-transaction-volume/)
captures all on-chain activity, including payments, smart contract
interactions, and wallet transfers. Comparing this with trading volume reveals
whether an asset’s activity stems from speculation or genuine use.

#### The Importance of Context

While Santiment's tools are powerful, it's crucial to remember that context is
key. Don't rely solely on one metric or indicator. Instead, use a combination
of data and analysis to make informed decisions.
