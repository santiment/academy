A message from Maksim Balashevich, our founder:

> Excited to have you onboard - together we are crossing the sea from a centralized to a decentralized world, from uncertainty to clarity, from too much noise to "I get only what I need when I need it."
>
> This is a pretty long way to get to the final destination. But as is the case with every big journey, it starts with the first step. I’m excited we get to walk it together.
