Registered [SanR.app](https://sanr.app/) users can unlock free access to the [Sanbase platform](https://app.santiment.net/) by earning **SanR points**. This access includes all features provided under the [Sanbase Pro plan](https://academy.santiment.net/products-and-plans/sanbase-pro-features), valid for 12 months. Points are earned through active participation and performance in SanR Epochs and Leagues, giving SanR users a chance to enjoy premium analytics without spending money!

## How it works

To obtain a SanR NFT, users would need to compete in the Epoch Competitions and earn points by winning the SanR Leagues. Players can compete in the Leagues by providing crypto price signals. Each Epoch includes three distinct Leagues, each ranking players based on different performance criteria. These Leagues renew every two weeks, rewarding the top 10 players in each League at the end of the period. [Video guide on how to navigate SanR.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvsqZMdhQNg)

The key to success is simple: post high-quality signals and stay consistent—whether your signals go up or down, consistency is what counts!

**Minting the SanR NFT**: When a user has collected 10,000 points, they can exchange their points to mint an NFT via SanR.app, granting them 12-month access to the Sanbase Pro plan.

1. **Head to your SanR profile page**
   To mint an NFT, you'll need a connected [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet. Start by visiting your profile page on [SanR.app](http://sanr.app/) by clicking the profile icon in the top-right corner of the application.
2. **Mint your NFT**
   Once you’ve accumulated 10,000 SanR points, head to the **Reward History** section of your profile and exchange the points to mint your Sanbase subscription NFT.
3. **Create Sanbase account**

   If you don’t already have an account, go to the [Sanbase](https://app.santiment.net/) page and create one. If you’re already a user, simply log in.

4. **Connect your MetaMask wallet to your Sanbase account in Account Settings**

   In your [Sanbase Account Settings](https://app.santiment.net/account), connect the **same MetaMask address** that was used to mint your NFT. This step is crucial to access the Sanbase Pro features.
