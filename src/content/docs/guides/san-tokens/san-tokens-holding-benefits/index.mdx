There are several benefits for our SAN token holders:

- Sanbase Subscription Discount
- Sanbase Payment with SAN Tokens
- Sanbase Subscription in exchange for providing liquidity in the SAN/ETH Liquidity Pool on Uniswap

## Use SAN Tokens for Discounts

> :bulb: You can now use SAN tokens for a discount.
> :point_right: Holding more than 1,000 SAN tokens provides a 20% discount on all our plans.

This discount will be automatically applied to your account if you log in with your crypto wallet or connect your wallet to your existing account.

## Sanbase Payment with SAN Tokens

You can burn your SAN Tokens to pay for a Sanbase subscription at 50% off the normal price. Once you burn your SAN tokens, we will credit your Sanbase account at a rate of twice the current market value. You can use your credits to pay for any available Sanbase plans.

<Notebox type="pin">

**Example:** If you burn 1000 SANs with an estimated value of $114.50 USD, we will credit your account with $229 USD in credit.

If you're unfamiliar with what burning entails, it's simply the act of intentionally sending tokens to an invalid address to permanently remove them from the available circulating supply.

You can pay for your subscription plan partially by using credits from SAN burning, and pay the remainder in USD.

If you are ready to burn SAN for a yearly Sanbase Pro subscription, please let us know at [support@santiment.net](mailto:support@santiment.net) and we will be happy to walk you through the process.
