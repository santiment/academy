## List of Tables

All our tables that contain XRPL-related data have the string 'xrp' in their name. To find them yourself, run the following query:

```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%xrp%'
```

The result will display the list of tables:

```
┌─name───────────────────┐
│ xrp_balances           │
│ xrp_balances_shard_v5  │
└────────────────────────┘
```

## Exploration of the Tables

We can inspect the tables with the commands we learned in [Exploration](/santiment-queries/exploration/).

Below, we have listed all the XRPL tables with their columns and a brief description of each.
