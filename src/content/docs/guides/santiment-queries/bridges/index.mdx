## Overview

A crypto bridge is a platform or protocol that facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrencies between different blockchain networks, promoting interoperability and liquidity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In **Santiment Queries**, we collect data from platforms or protocols which are trading cryptocurrencies across diverse blockchain networks:

- Across
- Arbitrum_bridge
- Avalanche
- Manta_pacific
- Multichain
- Op_bridge
- Polygon_bridge
- Squid
- Stargate
- Wbtc
- Zksync_era_bridge
- Zksync_lite

## Usage

Data Analysis and Reporting: This repository facilitates the analysis and reporting of transactions across various types of bridges, offering valuable insights into their utilization and acceptance.

Monitoring and Alert Systems: Utilizing transaction data from bridges, teams can establish monitoring and alert systems to detect irregular or questionable activities across diverse bridge networks.

Integration with Santiment Products: The exported data can seamlessly integrate with other Santiment products, like Sanbase, enhancing the overall understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape.

## Exploring the Tables

We can inspect the table using the commands we learned in [Exploration](/guides/santiment-queries/exploration/).

Here, we've provided the Bridge Transactions table along with its columns, concise descriptions, and a few sample queries for you to delve into the data.

### bridge_transactions

The `bridge_transactions` table is designed to capture and store detailed information about transactions occurring on a bridge between different blockchain networks. Each row in this table represents a single transaction, and the table includes various attributes to provide comprehensive insights into the transaction process. It has the following columns:

- **tx_hash** (_String_): Hash of the transaction.
- **log_index** (_UInt32_): Log index of the event.
- **dt** (_DateTime_): Date and time of the transaction
- **chain_in** (_String_): The target blockchain to recieve the funds.
- **chain_out** (_String_): The Blockchain from where the transaction was initiated
- **contract_addr** (_String_): Address of the involved smart contract.
- **token_in** (_Nullable(String)_): Type of token received from the bridge.
- **token_out** (_Nullable(String)_): Type of token sent into the bridge.
- **amount_in** (_UInt256_): Quantity of token_in.
- **amount_out** (_UInt256_): Quantity of token_out.
- **project_name** (_String_): Name or identifier of the associated project.
- **user** (_String_): Identifier of the transaction initiator.
- **args** (_String_): Additional transaction parameters or data
- **asset_in_ref_id** (_UInt64_): Reference ID of the currency contract that can be used to retrieve additional information about the asset from the `asset_metadata` table.
- **asset_out_ref_id** (_UInt64_): Reference ID of the currency contract that can be used to retrieve additional information about the asset from the `asset_metadata` table.
- **computed_at** (_DateTime_): Timestamp indicating when the transaction details were recorded in the database.

## Sample Queries

We've put together a dashboard with several queries to assist you in monitoring transaction volume and count, as well as the top 10 transactions or bridge flows. You can utilize our queries for a quick data check, or dive deeper by clicking on each query's name within the dashboard to customize them to your preferences.
