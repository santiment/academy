Social trends functionality consists of 5 tools:

- [Trending words](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends)
- [Trending coins](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends/trending-coins)
- [Historical Crypto Trends](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends/crypto-trends)
- [Key narratives](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends/crypto-narratives)

Let's take a closer look at each of these tools:

## Trending Words

[Trending words](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends?) **page contains the
hourly `Top 10` trending words related to crypto, sourced from more than 6000
crypto-specific social media channels.**

The more mentions a word starts receiving compared to the previous period, the
more it is trending. This allows you to find words whose discussions in the
cryptocurrency space are currently gaining popularity.

**Two purposes for this tool:**

- To provide a quick overview of the most discussed topics currently in the
  crypto social media.
- To provide simple AI explanations for why topics are trending and why they
  might be growing.

### Calculation Methodology

The analysis of a large number of crypto information sources identifies the
stories that are gaining popularity in the crypto community. So at any given
moment, you can see what's trending in crypto.

To do this, _every 60 minutes we calculate the top 10 words with the biggest
spike in social media mentions compared to their average social volume over the
previous 2 weeks._

This signals an abnormally high interest in a previously uninspiring topic,
making the list practical for discovering new and developing talking points in
the crypto community.

The results are sourced from more than 6000 crypto-specific social media
channels, including:

- 500+ Telegram groups
- 500+ crypto subreddits
- 400+ crypto substack newsletters
- 5000+ Twitter accounts

#### Hype Score

The Hype Score is the primary criterion for ranking words on our list. It's
based on this [formula](/metrics/emerging-trends/#hype-score) developed
by Santiment, which analyzes all social media messages.

Using [social volume](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume)
and number of unique authors we rank words by popularity in social media at the
moment.

A higher **Hype Score** indicates that for the last 24 hours this particular
word or topic became more valuable for the audience compared to previous 14
days.

### How to use it

1. **Get a 1-minute overview of the biggest (developing) stories in crypto**

   Crypto social media is filled with noise and numerous minor or irrelevant
   stories. Our curated list is designed to filter out this noise, focusing
   only on topics that have garnered significant attention. Additionally, our
   list often highlights important stories that might have been overlooked by
   major crypto publications.

2. **Spot local tops and hype peaks**

   Based on our experience, we've found that the appearance of a token's ticker
   on our Top 10 list can serve as an effective indicator of a local top. If
   the coin is already in an uptrend, its presence on our list could suggest
   that a local top is imminent, indicating that the hype surrounding the coin
   has reached its peak. [See our

## Historical Crypto Trends

over time and study the impact of these changes on asset prices. This tool
is useful for those who want to see the big picture and historical changes
in trends.

![noborder](image19.png)

The main page shows the most popular trends at the moment. But if you need
information on a specific trend, you can use the search bar.

### Using keywords (OR and AND) and parentheses in searches

One graph will be displayed for the total mentions, as well as one for each
data source. You can use `AND`, `OR`, and parentheses to logically combine
multiple search terms. Here are some examples:

- `btc moon` – This will search for the exact phrase "btc moon".
- `btc AND moon` – This will search for messages where both "btc" and "moon"
  appear. The words do not need to be next to each other.
- `btc OR moon` – This will search for messages where either "btc" or "moon"
  appears.
- `(btc OR bitcoin) AND moon` – This will search for messages where "moon"
  appears with either "btc" or "bitcoin".

### Page with social context analysis of a particular trend

For example, let's take the Trend Analysis page for the query [bitcoin or
btc](https://app.santiment.net/labs/trends/explore/bitcoin%20or%20btc).

On the page you can see the [social volume](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume/) chart of this
trend, on which you can overlay the [social dominance chart](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-dominance/#definition), the
price of a certain asset, the correlation of the social trend with the price of
which you want to study, and more.

![noborder](image20.png)

Below you can see the dynamics of [social volume](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume/) change by social
data sources separately.

You can see graphs for Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, 4chan, and sometimes others.

The example on the screenshot shows that the spike in social activity on the
\$PEPE coin on the 4Chan site preceded a sharp price increase, while on the
other sources the spike in social activity occurred during or after the price
increase.

![noborder](image22.png)

Under “Average” you can see the total social volume compared to the social
volume of your selected topic.

![noborder](image23.png)

Nearby, the Social Context feature shows the most used words around your main
keyword on cryptocurrency social media. The size and color of each word in the
cloud represents its frequency in comments that also mention your main keyword.

to click “Compare” and add a trend.
