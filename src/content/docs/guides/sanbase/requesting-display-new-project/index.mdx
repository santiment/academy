At Santiment, we work directly with Ethereum on-chain data, which allows us to display information about any token whose contract address is known. However, due to the high volume of tokens available, we have chosen to only make a curated and continuously expanding list of tokens searchable on Sanbase.

To request the addition of a new token to Sanbase, or to add a known team wallet containing significant assets held by the team, please use the form provided below:

While we appreciate token holders requesting their favorite tokens, we prioritize direct requests from a project's team, especially those that provide information about their funding.
