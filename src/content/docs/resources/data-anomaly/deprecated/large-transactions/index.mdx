## Definition

**Large Transaction Signal** indicates transactions with large value in USD.

In order to filter most valuable transactions for each transaction a threshold value is defined. The threshold is the USD value of the top-fifth transaction in last 30 days.

If the transaction's approximate value in USD is above the threshold value, a signal is fired.

Approximate transaction values are calculated by multiplying the amount of transferres coins to closest coin's price value using price data with 5 minutes interval for each transaction.
