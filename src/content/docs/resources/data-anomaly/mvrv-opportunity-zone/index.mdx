## Definition

**MVRV Opportunity (Undervaluation) Zone** Data Anomaly is triggered when the MVRV metric indicates that the asset is undervalued, signaling a favorable entry point for long-term investors. This anomaly activates when the current MVRV value falls below the lower threshold based on historical MVRV dips over the recent period, highlighting potential accumulation opportunities.

## Use Cases

- This anomaly is valuable for long-term investors tracking market cycles to identify ideal entry points for accumulating assets.
- The MVRV Opportunity Zone Data Anomaly becomes even more powerful when used in conjunction with the [MVRV Danger (Overvaluation) Zone](/data-anomaly/mvrv-danger-zone) Data Anomaly. While the Opportunity Data Anomaly identifies undervaluation and potential accumulation points, the Danger Anomaly warns of potential overvaluation and the risk of a price correction. By leveraging both anomalies, you can strategically time their entry and exit points.
