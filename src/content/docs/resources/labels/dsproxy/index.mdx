## Description

DSProxy, developed by DappHub, is a smart wallet that offers a unique feature allowing developers to execute multiple 
contract calls in a single transaction. In contrast to vanilla externally owned accounts (EOAs), which are restricted 
to interacting with just one contract per transaction, DSProxy provides greater functionality and flexibility for 
executing complex actions on the Ethereum blockchain.
