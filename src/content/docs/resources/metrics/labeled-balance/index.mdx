## Description
Metrics that show labeled addresses inflow, outflow and balances

* `inflow_per_label_and_owner` - inflow of a given owner
* `outflow_per_label_and_owner` - outflow of a given owner
* `balance_per_label_and_owner_delta` - balance change of a given owner
* `balance_per_owner` - balance of a given owner

Please note that metrics may undergo changes in historical values due to automated recalculations triggered monthly. We constantly update our labels which helps us to keep labels as fresh as possible but result historical data changes. Any modifications to labels, social sources, or relevant jobs will prompt recalculation for the previous month's data. Within a 12 hour period, metric can be supplemented with new data. Additionally, adjustments to labels automatically trigger recalculation of labeled balances.

Available [labels](/labels):
* `centralized_exchange`
* `decentralized_exchange`
* `defi`
* `eth2stakingcontract`
* `deposit`
