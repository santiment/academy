## Description
[Fraxlend](https://app.frax.finance/fraxlend) Protocol is a decentralized lending and borrowing 
platform designed to facilitate efficient and secure financial transactions within the DeFi 
ecosystem. It operates by allowing users to lend their digital assets to earn interest or borrow 
against their holdings, leveraging the stability and flexibility of the FRAX stablecoin. The 
protocol employs smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and automation of all lending 
activities, minimizing risks associated with traditional financial systems.
