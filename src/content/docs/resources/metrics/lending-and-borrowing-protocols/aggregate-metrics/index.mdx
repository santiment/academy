## Description

Aggregate metrics combine liquidation, borrowing, and repayment activity across all
supported lending and borrowing protocols. They track the total value of new debt,
repayments, and liquidations, separated between stablecoins and non-stablecoins.
This breakdown makes it easier to analyze differences in user behavior and risk profiles
across asset types. By aggregating these values at the market level, the metrics provide
a clear view of overall lending dynamics in DeFi.

### Aggregate Metrics

- `total_lending_liquidations_non_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of liquidations for non-stablecoin assets
- `total_lending_liquidations_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of liquidations for stablecoin assets
- `total_lending_new_debt_non_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of new debt issued in non-stablecoin assets
- `total_lending_new_debt_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of new debt issued in stablecoin assets
- `total_lending_repayments_non_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of repayments made in non-stablecoin assets
- `total_lending_repayments_stablecoins_usd` - Total USD value of repayments made in stablecoin assets
