## Description
Compound is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum 
blockchain that allows individuals to lend and borrow digital assets without 
intermediaries. Compound is designed to create a market for lending and borrowing 
digital assets, where users can earn interest by lending their assets and 
borrowers can obtain loans by using their assets as collateral.
