## Definition

The number of distinct addresses that participated in a transfer for the given
asset in the past 24 hours window. Each address is counted only once for the
window. Both the senders and the receivers are counted.

This metric is similar to the Daily Active Addresses. The difference is that the
daily active addresses is computed on whole days only - it counts the active
addresses for every day (between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59). The active addresses
24h is computed every 5 minutes and counts the active addresses for
the past 24 hours. Example: The value of the metric at 17:30pm on March 22
contains the active addresses in the interval [17:30pm March 21, 17:30pm March
22].
