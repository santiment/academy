## Description

The Transaction Count metric indicates the number of unique transactions occurring on the network 
within a specific day.

As an alternative to the transaction count metric, there's the Payments Count metric, which reflects 
the number of individual payments made on the network within a specific day.

The difference between Transaction Count and Payments Count lies in the scenario where a single 
transaction includes multiple transfers. In such cases, the Transaction Count registers this as a single 
transaction, while the Payments Count registers each individual transfer within that transaction.
