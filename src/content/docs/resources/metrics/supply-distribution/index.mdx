## Description

The supply distribution metric offers a comprehensive view of how the holdings of a particular
token are distributed among its user base across different balance intervals. These
intervals represent predefined ranges of token balances held by individual users. By
examining this metric, observers can identify trends such as whether a significant portion of
the supply is concentrated among a small number of large holders or if the distribution is more
evenly spread across a wider user base. Such insights are valuable for stakeholders, as they
provide crucial information about the level of decentralization within the cryptocurrency network,
potential market liquidity dynamics, and overall ecosystem health. Moreover, understanding supply
distribution aids in assessing the potential impact of large holders on price volatility and market
sentiment, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts.
