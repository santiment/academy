## Definition

There are three separate metrics regarding exchange funds flow:

- `exchange_inflow` - How many coins/tokens are moved from non-exchange to
  exchange wallets.
- `exchange_outflow` - How many coins/tokens are moved from exchange to
  non-exchange wallets.
- `exchange_balance` - The difference inflow-outflow (inflow minus outflow). The
  usefulness of this metric comes from the fact that transactions from
  missing/unknown exchange wallets to missing/unknown exchange wallets cancel
  each other.

Some of the metrics have a USD equivalent - the raw value is multiplied by the
price of the coin/token at the given date. The available USD metrics are
`exchange_inflow_usd` and `exchange_outflow_usd`

## Use Case

It's not uncommon for large inflows of tokens to the exchange to precede
rapid price growth.

Here's that exact scenario in case of
[aeternity](https://aeternity.com/), a blockchain platform that enables
scalable smart contracts:

> Note: Aeternity moved from ERC20 to their own blockchain and Santiment does not have data for this new blockchain.

When a large amount of tokens flow out of the exchange, on the other
hand, the price is likely to fall soon thereafter.
