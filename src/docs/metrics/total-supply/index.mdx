## Definition

Total Supply is the total amount of coins or tokens belonging to a particular cryptocurrency
that have been created or mined, and are currently in circulation, including those that may
be locked or reserved.

Supply in Profit metric is computed by summing all token amounts that were last transferred when
the price of token was less then the current price.

Percent of Supply in Profit represents the ratio between Supply in Profit and
[Circulation Supply](/metrics/circulation). This metric measures weather the market is in
depression or euphoria stage. If token is breaking all time highs every holder is in profit,
so the metric value is 100%. On the other side, in the bear markets there are usually more then
half of tokens are in loss, so the metric value drops below 50%.
