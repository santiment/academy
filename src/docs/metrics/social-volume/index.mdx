## Definition

Social Volume is build on top of the [Social Data](/metrics/details/social-data).

The total number of [social data text documents](/metrics/details/social-data) that
contain the given search term at least once. Examples of documents are telegram
messages and reddit posts. If a single short telegram message includes the word
`crypto` more than once, this message will increase the social volume of the
word `crypto` by 1. If a long reddit post contains the word `crypto` 10 times,
this again will increase the social volume of the word `crypto` by 1.

Social Volume can be computed for an [asset](/glossary#asset) or for arbitrary
search terms. When an asset is used, a special search term is constructed. For
example querying the social volume for `santiment` will result in a search term
similar to:

> (SAN OR santiment OR santoken OR santimentnet OR sancoin OR sansan OR sancoin)
> AND NOT ((san AND francisco) OR (san AND fran) OR (san AND diego) OR (san AND
> marino) OR (san AND jose))

which includes documents containg `santiment` or `san` but excludes documents
that contain common phrases containing `san` like `San Francisco`.

The arbitrary search term can be:

- One particular word like `bitcoin`, `crypto` or `blockchain`.
- An exact phrase (surrounded by double quotation marks) like `"when moon"`,
  `"buy high sell low"` or `"btc rekt"`.
- [Lucene Query](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html) - a
  search term that allows for logical operators. Examples:
  - `OR` - The union of two search results. `btc OR bitcoin` returns the
    documents that contain at least one of the words `btc` and `bitcoin`
  - `AND` - The intersection of two search results. `btc AND moon` returns the
    documents that contain both of the words `btc` and `moon` at the same time.
  - `NOT` - Filter out documents that contain a given search term. `btc NOT lambo`
    returns the documents that contain the word `btc` and does not
    contain the word `lambo`
  - `?` - A wildcard search. `?` in the search term means that it can match any
    character. For example the query `btc AND 1?k` will be the combined result
    of `btc AND 10k`, `btc AND 11k`, ..., `btc AND 19k` (but also nonsense like
    `btc AND 1sk`, `btc AND 1Ak`, etc. will be matched)
  - Many other operators can be used, documentation for which can be found in
    the lucene query syntax documentation.

The operators can be combined and higher precedence can be expressed by using
parentheses `(btc OR bitcoin) AND moon NOT lambo` - it will result in all the
documents that contain either the words `btc` and `moon` or the words `bitcoin`
and `moon` in one document, excluding any documents that contain the word
`lambo`.

We constantly update our labels which helps us to keep labels as fresh as possible but result historical data changes. Any modifications to labels, social sources, or relevant jobs will prompt recalculation for the previous month's data. Within a 12 hour period, metric can be supplemented with new data.
