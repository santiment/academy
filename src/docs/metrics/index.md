Santiment brings a comprehensive set of metrics together in one place so you can get a better picture of what’s happening with your favorite crypto assets and/or crypto markets in general.
We emphasize plotting metrics against price over time, to more easily spot how trends and events correlate with price action.

## Financial

Traditional fundamentals including price, volume and market cap, mean coin age

- [Price in USD](/metrics/price/#price-usd)
- [Price in BTC](/metrics/price/#price-btc)
- [OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close)](/metrics/price/#ohlc)
- [Trading Volume in USD](/metrics/price/#volume-usd)
- [Marketcap in USD](/metrics/price/#marketcap-usd)
- [Mean Coin Age](/metrics/mean-coin-age)

## Social/Sentiment

Metrics taken from measuring social activity on crypto-related forums and channels, plus custom sentiment measurements analyzing crowd behavior. Includes emerging trend words and projects, word clouds to display related words and the possibility to enter custom search terms.
