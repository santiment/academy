## Description

Debt is defined as an amount borrowed and could be denominated in USD or other currencies or tokens depending on the specific metric.

Debt metrics are split between the venues where the debt originates from. Santiment covers a number of DeFi protocols and provides data primarily for on-chain debt. More details can be found in the [Lending and Borrowing Protocols](/metrics/lending-and-borrowing-protocols) page.

Currently, Santiment does not provide data for debt originating from centralized exchanges, banks, and other traditional venues.
