## Definition

Circulation shows number of unique coins/tokens being used during a time period.

Examples:

- `circulation_1d` - Shows how many unique coins/tokens were transacted during a
  day. If one token/coin changes hands 5 times on a given day, it will be
  counted once by the token circulation, but 5 times by the transaction volume.
- `circulation_1y` - Shows how many unique coins/tokens were transacted for the
  past 1 year.

There are also circulation metrics `circulation_usd_*` that represent the USD value of all
unique coins or tokens that were transacted within a single day. Unlike simple circulation
metrics that count the unique cryptocurrencies moved, `circulation_usd_*` metrics convert
the quantity of these coins or tokens into their equivalent value in USD.

## SanAPI

Available under the `circulation` and `circulation_<timebound>` names.

Gets the total amount of tokens that have been sent at least once during each
day for given time period. Projects are referred to by a unique identifier
(slug). This metric is calculated daily, so the interval should be selected
accordingly.

```graphql explorer
{
  getMetric(metric: "circulation_1d") {
    timeseriesDataJson(
      slug: "santiment"
      from: "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      to: "2020-01-07T00:00:00Z"
      interval: "1d"
    )
  }
}
```

Without any suffixes like \_1d, the metric returns the number of coins/tokens
ever seen up until now, which is equal to the total supply at that datetime.

```graphql explorer
{
  getMetric(metric: "circulation") {
    timeseriesDataJson(
      slug: "santiment"
      from: "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      to: "2020-01-07T00:00:00Z"
      interval: "1d"
    )
  }
}
```
