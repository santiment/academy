## Description

Liquidations are defined as the forced sale of collateral for the purpose of capitalizing or repaying a debt position.

Liquidation metrics are split between the venues where the events originate from. Santiment covers a number of DeFi protocols and provides data primarily for on-chain liquidations. More details can be found in the [Lending and Borrowing Protocols](/metrics/lending-and-borrowing-protocols) page.

Currently, Santiment does not provide data for liquidations originating from centralized exchanges, banks, and other traditional venues.
