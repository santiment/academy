## Definition

**Liquidations** signal is designed to monitor significant liquidations on the blockchain. A rapid succession of signals indicates a sharp increase in the scale of these liquidations.

A huge liquidation in the crypto space refers to the forced selling of a trader's position, typically on leveraged trades, when the market moves against them. In the context of cryptocurrencies, liquidation occurs when a trader borrows funds to trade (using margin or leverage) and the value of their position falls below a certain threshold, at which point the exchange automatically sells the assets to cover the loss.
