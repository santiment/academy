## Definition

**Binance Funding Rate** is designed to monitor significant changes in Binance's funding rate for perpetual futures contracts. Persistent spikes or drops in the funding rate can indicate extreme market sentiment, allowing traders to anticipate price movements or periods of heightened volatility.

Funding rate is a periodic payment made to ensure the price of perpetual futures contracts remains anchored to the spot market price. A positive funding rate indicates that the perpetual contract price is higher than the spot price, with long position holders paying shorts. A negative funding rate suggests the opposite, with short position holders paying longs.
