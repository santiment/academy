## Definition

**ETH Whale Dump** signal is designed to detect potential large-scale ETH dumps by monitoring whale wallet behaviors. It specifically focuses on identifying significant outflows from addresses that could indicate selling pressure from major holders. The signal uses a 30-day holding period as a key parameter to distinguish between normal trading activity and potential dump scenarios.
