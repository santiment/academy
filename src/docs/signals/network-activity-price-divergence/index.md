## Definition

**Network Activity - Price Divergence** signal identifies anomalous price surges that are not accompanied by a corresponding rise in network activity (growth). It flags potentially unsustainable or speculative price increases that are not backed by healthy user adoption or blockchain usage.

The detection logic is based on the modified z-score applied to the price-to-growth momentum ratio, using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for robustness against outliers. We smooth raw metrics to reduce noise and focus on consistent deviations from historical behavior.

The signal is triggered only if the price growth exceeds 3% on the same day â€” ensuring the alert is relevant for significant bullish moves.
