Some metrics have **special** restrictions. They do not follow the time
restrictions of the product plans but their own.

## Realized Value / MVRV metrics

Those restrictions hold for any metric that contains "**mvrv**" or
"**realized_value**" in its canonical name, like `mvrv_usd`, `mvrv_usd_7d`,
`realized_value`, `realized_value_1d`, etc.
