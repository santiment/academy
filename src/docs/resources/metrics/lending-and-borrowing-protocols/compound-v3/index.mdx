## Description
Compound V3 is the third version of the [Compound](https://compound.finance/) protocol.
New version represents a significant shift in the DeFi landscape by introducing 
a unified borrowing market model. In this model, the base asset can be borrowed 
against other assets.

Currently, there are three markets: the ETH market, the USDC market, and the USDT market. 
In each market, users can provide different assets as collateral and borrow the market's 
asset (WETH, USDC, or USDT).

This transformation carries several advantages. First, it enhances security 
for users across all assets within the Compound ecosystem. Second, it allows 
for increased collateral ratios, providing more flexibility for borrowers. 
This also decreases the liability for each market since all debt is settled in 
the form of assets.
