## Description

A proxy entity is a special type of entity that serves as an intermediary between other entities. 

For example: Instead of interacting directly with the target contract, all calls are directed through the proxy, which then delegates 
the request to the intended target contract. This allows for a greater degree of control and flexibility over the 
contract's behavior.
