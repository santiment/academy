trading decisions? [Santiment.net](https://app.santiment.net/?utm_source=academy_gettingstarted) is a powerful platform that provides you with the data and tools to understand the underlying forces driving the market. 

Here is a summary of the benefits and features of Santiment, to help you understand the platform might be able to enhance your trading decisions.

## The Santiment Advantage: Data-Driven Insights

Santiment's core idea is simple: price charts only tell part of the story. What really drives markets is how people behave, and Santiment focuses on digging into those behavioral patterns to explain why prices move the way they do.

Santiment focuses on:

- **On-Chain Metrics**: Analyzing blockchain transactions to understand the actual movement and usage of cryptocurrencies.
- **Social Sentiment:** Tracking discussions and sentiment online to granularly measure the prevailing narratives, moods, and trends.
- **Key Stakeholder Activity:** Monitoring the actions of large holders ("whales" and "sharks") to identify potential market shifts.

This comprehensive approach provides a more holistic view of the market,
allowing you to make more nuanced and informed decisions.

## Practical Use Cases

### Identifying Market Tops and Bottoms

Santiment's tools can help you identify potential market turning points. Here are a few small examples:

#### Tops

- [Social Volume Spikes](/for-traders/#spot-tops-and-exit-opportunities):
  Extreme spikes in social volume during a rally can indicate a local top,
  especially for smaller-cap coins.
- [Sentiment](/metrics/sentiment-metrics/#what-is-sentiment):
  When the crowd is overly bullish, it can be a supporting data-point that a top is near.
 
#### Bottoms

- [Contrarian Approach](/for-traders/#spot-bottoms-and-entry-opportunities): Research suggests that the market often moves in the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations.
- [Network Activity](/education-and-use-cases/understanding-short-term-market-trends/#network-activity): Significantly increased network activity can support the hypothesis of a potential bottom.

#### Monitoring Volatility

- [Token Age Consumed](/education-and-use-cases/timing-market-volatility-with-token-age-consumed/): Alerts you to potential trend reversals by tracking the movement of long-held, previously idle coins.
- [ETF Flow](/metrics/etf-flow): Helps you see the activity of the more traditional retail crowd.

#### Understanding Real-World Utility

- [Transaction volume](/education-and-use-cases/trading-and-transaction-volume/): Captures all on-chain activity, including payments, smart contract
interactions, and wallet transfers. Comparing this with trading volume reveals
whether an asset’s activity stems from speculation or genuine use.

#### The Importance of Context

While Santiment's tools are powerful, it's crucial to remember that context is
key. Don't rely solely on one metric or indicator. Instead, use a combination
of data points to support your hypothesis and ultimately your trading decisions.
