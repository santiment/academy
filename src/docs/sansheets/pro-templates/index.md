## The Perks of Being a Pro Subscriber on Sanbase

As many of you know, Sanbase is a free-to-use platform for researching and studying on-chain and behavioral analytics in the crypto markets. However, there is a paid version called "Pro" that unlocks numerous features and models unavailable to our free users. Check out the [list of perks we offer to our Pro subscribers](https://app.santiment.net/pricing) and discover all the benefits that come with being an insider on our platform!

One of these perks is access to our Sansheets plugin and the various templates we have built with it. This article will provide an overview of these templates.

_In case you are already a Sanbase Pro subscriber and want to copy these templates for yourself, please [get in touch](mailto:support@santiment.net)._

## Maximal Mean Dollar Age Template

This template visualizes the [Mean Dollar Age](https://insights.santiment.net/read/%F0%9F%93%A2-mean-age-653/) of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various ERC20 coins in comparison to one another.

Developed by Santiment, Mean Dollar Age calculates the average age of all dollars invested in acquiring a particular coin. This metric identifies accumulation and sell cycles for any coin, and identifying dips in Mean Dollar Age can serve as a novel bullish indicator.

## Top Holders Template

Crypto is still a whale's playground. [This template](https://insights.santiment.net/read/top-token-holders-and-their-role-as-leading-indicators-5618) monitors the behavior of the largest addresses holding Ethereum and various ERC-20 coins.

The template includes a dozen views of top whales' behavior, such as balance changes, significant accumulation/sell-off events, and week-to-week adjustments to the total supply held.

## NVT Template

This template calculates the NVT for BTC, ETH, and several ERC-20 coins, and assigns a bullish or bearish value to their historical and present-day performance.

The idea behind the NVT is simple - if the value transferred on the network (token circulation) is too low relative to the network's valuation (market cap), the asset should be considered overvalued and due for a correction. Conversely, if the value transferred on the network is too high compared to its current valuation, the NVT would deem the asset undervalued and ripe for a breakout.

## Price-DAA Divergence Template

We [have found](https://insights.santiment.net/read/price---daily-addresses-divergence%3A-%0Aa-primer-on-on-chain-trading-strategies-2222) that major differences in the coin's price and network activity trends can present opportune times to buy OR sell, depending on the trend's direction.

This template triggers BUY and SELL signals for Bitcoin and Ethereum based on major divergences in price and the amount of daily addresses interacting with the coin.

## Network Growth & Daily Active Addresses Template

This template compares the [network growth](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/network-growth/) and [daily active address](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/daily-active-addresses/) percentage changes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects over time. Generally, many projects create new addresses at a similar percentage rate to one another as markets ebb and flow. Identifying which projects are creating new addresses and growing their network at a faster rate than their price is an excellent strategy to find buy-low opportunities.

## MVRV and MVRV Long/Short Difference Ratio Template

The [MVRV](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/mvrv/) ratio is calculated by dividing the market cap (market value or MV) by the realized cap (total realized value or RV). This ratio provides a reliable estimate of how overvalued or undervalued the current market cap is.

In addition, we offer the MVRV Long/Short Difference comparison in this template to help visualize which projects are above or below their average line of profitable traders. If the ratio is above 0%, then on average, Ethereum holders will profit if they sell their coins now. If it is below 0%, then the average holder will realize a loss if they sell.

## Velocity vs. Price Template

[Velocity](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/velocity/) is an underutilized method for researching the speed at which money circulates in the crypto economy. It is calculated by dividing a token's transaction volume (in USD) by its market cap (in USD).

Similar to the Daily Active Addresses Template, this model helps visualize when tokens are being overbought or oversold based on the historical trends of its velocity metric.

## Thresholds Crossed Template

Understanding how many times the price of a project has moved above or below a round number USD value, or a psychological barrier, can provide valuable insights into the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency markets. Those who believe that crossing above a certain level means "it will never fall back below again" can be shown just how often prices have reset time and time again.

This template is excellent for understanding support levels and identifying price points where there is a significant push and pull, along with psychological polarization among traders. Utilizing this information can be advantageous in your trading strategy.

## Most Profitable Days for Trading Cryptocurrency

As [we've tested in the past](https://insights.santiment.net/read/backtesting-the-week%3A-which-days-are-best-for-trading-crypto%3F-1139), knowing which days have the best historical ROI can help reduce risk and craft effective market strategies.

This template determines the best trading days (historically) for any coin in the Santiment database, with adjustable time ranges for Pro users.

## Distribution Index

[Our research](https://insights.santiment.net/read/314) has shown that distributed coins (supply dispersed among many addresses) tend to outperform concentrated coins (much of circulating supply held by 'whales'). This index calculates the top 10 most distributed and most concentrated ERC-20 coins (within the top 50) over the last month.

## ETH-ERC20 Correlation Index

[Our previous analysis](https://medium.com/santiment/eth-vs-erc-20-a-tale-of-two-market-caps-94b2aca58e5e) indicates that ERC-20 coins tend to be less correlated to Ethereum during bull markets and exhibit higher correlation during bear markets. This index charts the correlation of the ERC-20 market cap to the ETH market cap over the last 3 months.

## Stablecoin Volatility Index

Stablecoins may be more volatile than you think. This presents an interesting market opportunity, as one could potentially invest in low-volatility stablecoins and trade during outbreaks in their more volatile counterparts.

This Santiment Index ranks the 15 largest stablecoins from most to least volatile over the past 30 days.

## Least Correlated Coins to BTC & ETH

According to our research, a portfolio of coins that are least correlated to both Bitcoin and Ethereum tends to perform particularly well during bull cycles. This index calculates the 20 least correlated coins to BTC & ETH over the past 30 days.
