## Description

Owner is a standalone label that denotes the person or company that controls a given address. Note that the owner label is not a nickname. Owner is a broader term than nickname, which is an owner's attribute (e.g. Vitalik Buterin might have several nicknames: 'Vitaliy', 'ETH_daddy', 'John Galt', etc.).

In most cases, the Owner label is connected with other labels (such as [centralized_exchange](/labels/centralized-exchange)).
