## Description

Any smart contract that is an NFT collection contract should have the `nft-collection` label assigned to it. There are two main standards for NFT contracts: ERC721 and ERC1155. We make sure to assign a label for each standard.

NFT collections are usually identified by their [NFT collection name](/labels/nft-collection-name) and [NFT collection symbol](/labels/nft-collection-symbol). If the collection has a name and/or symbol that is easily accessible, we create labels for those too.

## [Label fqn](/labels/label-fqn)

`santiment/nft_collection:v1`
