## Description

Denotes a smart contract that follows the ERC-1155 standard.


ERC1155 is a multi-token standard developed on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the creation of fungible
and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. It can also be used to create semi-fungible tokens, which combine
elements of both fungible and non-fungible tokens, providing greater flexibility in token design and functionality.
