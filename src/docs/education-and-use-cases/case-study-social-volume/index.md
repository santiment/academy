### Metrics

[Social Volume metric](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume/#social-volume) + [Weighted Sentiment](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/sentiment-metrics/weighted-sentiment-metrics/)

### Scenario

On May 21st, 2025, Mark, a part-time crypto trader, was monitoring his positions. While using [a Screener](https://app.santiment.net/screener) to look at similar metrics across all his assets he noticed the [Social Volume metric](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume/#social-volume), which detects genuine asset mentions across several social media platforms, spike for “Avalanche” (AVAX)(1). The metric showed a ~300% increase in discussions on Telegram and Twitter that coincided with a recent upward movement in the price. Curious, he cross-referenced this with the [Weighted Sentiment metric](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/sentiment-metrics/weighted-sentiment-metrics/#definition), revealing that most of the chatter around AVAX was bullish.

**Decision:**
Mark decided this was indicating a short term top so he sold his position of 1000 AVAX tokens at $25.21 for $25,210 USD.

**Outcome:**
The token crashed over the next month by -41%, bottoming in late June 2025. Mark stayed on the lookout for a moment to reenter the position because of his long term outlook on the project, mainly looking for bearish days with lower social volume since prices often rebounded in those scenarios.
