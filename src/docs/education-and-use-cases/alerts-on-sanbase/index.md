Sanbase Alerts are a powerful tool designed to help you focus on what's most crucial in the ever-changing crypto market. With a plethora of metrics available on Sanbase and a vast array of crypto assets in the market, keeping track of every single daily fluctuation can be challenging. However, this vigilance is vital if you aim to not just observe the market, but also stay ahead of the curve.

Creating a tailored alert based on your unique perspective ensures that you remain in control of your crypto strategy.

Let's explore some of the potential ways you can leverage Sanbase Alerts.

## Setting Up an Age Consumed Alert

The Token Age Consumed metric monitors the activity of coins based on the duration they have remained in their current wallets. Spikes on the chart represent the movement of previously idle coins, which could be owned by long-term HODLers or even ICO investors.

An unusual spike may not necessarily indicate an imminent change. However, in certain instances, it could serve as a short-term indicator that the market is behaving differently. Users are thus alerted to manually verify whether this is potentially harmful or relevant to their position using all available tools.

Consider the chart below. If AAVE is an asset you are interested in, you could have been alerted on multiple occasions in the past six months. It seems that the spikes have been followed by a steady decrease in price.

Choosing the right conditions is a crucial step in the setup process. This part can be complex, but it's essential to ensure that you don't receive excessive noise or false triggers. It's highly recommended to carefully identify which market changes are significant for YOU. 

Let's explore how to do this for AAVE Age Consumed alerts.

### Step 3b: Understanding Percentage Increases

While a 100% increase might initially appear significant, it's important to examine the context. Refer to the chart below. As you can see, such increases have occurred almost weekly over the past six months. This frequency suggests that a 100% increase is a regular occurrence for this data set. Therefore, you may not want to set up notifications for such a common event.

### Step 3c: Adjusting the Metric

By continuously fine-tuning the metric, you'll notice that the data becomes more meaningful. Only a few significant spikes occur within the given period, suggesting that something noteworthy must have happened. 

These activities are prominent and likely warrant your attention. 

## Step 4: Set Up Your Preferred Notification Method

Once you've completed the previous steps, the final step is to set up your preferred method of receiving notifications. After this, your setup process is complete!
