Expectations are a powerful force in shaping financial markets. Yet, they can
also be your worst enemy if yours fall into the same category as most. It’s
common for the market to move in the opposite direction from what most
participants anticipate, and contrarian traders are typically the ones who most
commonly come out on top in volatile markets. Recognizing this, Sanbase
analyzes user discussions across all major crypto channels, offering a
data-driven perspective on the current sentiment and expectations within the
crowd.

With Santiment’s [**Historical Crypto Trends**](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends/crypto-trends) tool, you can
assess how collective expectations have matched up with actual market movements
in the past. This not only provides valuable context but also helps in
forecasting potential future changes by recognizing familiar patterns.

As you explore the tool’s graphs, you’ll encounter key metrics such as
[**social volume**](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-volume/#definition) and
[**social dominance**](https://academy.santiment.net/metrics/social-dominance/#social-dominance-for-an-asset).
These powerful market indicators both offer insight into the intensity and
focus of market conversations, as well as reveal how the subject matter of
these conversations transition between topics.

In this article, we’ll explore the primary queries within the
[**Historical Crypto Trends**](https://app.santiment.net/social-trends/crypto-trends) tool,
helping you gain a comprehensive understanding of market participants’
expectations and how these sentiments play out over time.

## Spotting Market Bottoms with the _Buy the Dip_ Query

![noborder](./image1.png)

Tracking the frequency of "buy the dip" mentions on social channels helps gauge
market sentiment. Spikes in these mentions signal investor optimism, often
after temporary rebounds that may still lead to further declines. Low volume of
conversations surrounding ‘buying the dip’ reflects fear and can indicate
potential buying opportunities. High volume reflects an overly eager crowd that
is not yet fearful, meaning the market dip is likely to continue longer.
Monitoring this trend with Sanbase provides valuable insights for timing market
entry points.

**Query text:**

```
buy AND dip
```

## Going Against the Crowd with BTC Price Expectations

![noborder](./image2.png)

Analyzing social chatter about Bitcoin’s future price reveals valuable
sentiment signals. Widespread predictions of unrealistically high prices
indicate market greed and often precede price pullbacks. In contrast, frequent
talk of extremely low prices reflects fear and can signal a potential market
bottom. Tracking these patterns with Sanbase helps identify shifts in sentiment
for more informed trading decisions. We recommend adjusting the thresholds of
these round number price mentions to consistently be around 10-15% above the
current market value of Bitcoin, and 10-15% below.

## Analyzing Crowd Mentions of Bear or Bull Market

![noborder](./image3.png)

Monitoring how often the crypto community references a "bull market" or "bear
market" provides essential insight into prevailing market sentiment. A sudden
surge in mentions of a "bull market" typically signals growing optimism, which
can sometimes indicate the market is becoming overheated and due for a
correction. Conversely, an increasing volume of "bear market" discussions often
reflects heightened pessimism and anxiety, which can suggest the market is
approaching or has reached a bottom.

**Query text:**

```
bull OR bullish
```

```
bear OR bearish
```

## Analyzing Mentions of "Higher" or "Lower" in Price Discussions

![noborder](./image4.png)
Tracking how often traders and market participants mention that prices will go
"higher" or "lower" offers valuable clues about market expectations. A spike in
conversations predicting that prices will move "higher" often signals growing
optimism and bullish sentiment, which can sometimes precede a period of
correction as the market becomes overconfident. On the other hand, an increase
in mentions of prices moving "lower" tends to reflect rising pessimism or fear,
which can point to an oversold market and a possible rebound.

**Query text:**

```
high OR higher`
```

```
low OR lower
```

## Analyzing Mentions of "Pump" and "Dump" in Market Discussions

![noborder](./image5.png)

Monitoring how frequently the crypto community uses terms like "pump" or "dump"
can offer critical insights into crowd behavior and short-term market
sentiment. A sudden increase in mentions of a potential "pump" often signals
heightened excitement and speculative interest, which can sometimes lead to
rapid price surges followed quickly by corrections as enthusiasm fades.
Conversely, a rise in "dump" discussions tends to indicate growing anxiety
about potential price drops, often surrounding fears of sell-offs or
manipulation.

**Query text:**

```
pump
```

```
dump
```

## Tariffs

![noborder](./image6.png)

In 2025, Donald Trump introduced tariffs that rocked traders’ opinions about
both stock and crypto markets. For the most part, tariffs are discussed at a
high frequency whenever there are new developments or changes to countries’
policies on tariffs. These policy changes often coincide with a shift in market
direction. Therefore, you can likely find profitable trades by buying if tariff
discussions spike while markets had been declining, or selling if tariff
discussions spike while markets had been rising.

**Query text:**

```
tarif OR tariff OR tariffs
```

## Altseason

![noborder](./image7.png)

When traders begin to become enthralled with altcoins, this is often a
reflection of greed or overconfidence in the markets. And if altcoins have been
on a prolonged rally, you may see a spike in the term “altseason”. This means
that traders are confident enough that the current altcoin rally will continue.
Since markets historically move the opposite direction of the crowd’s
expectations, you can interpret spikes in “altseason” as a bearish one in
almost all cases.

**Query text:**

```
(alt AND season) OR alts OR szn OR altseazon OR altseason OR (altcoin AND seazon)
```
