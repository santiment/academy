## Structure

This page is divided into two main sections:

1. **`Categories`**

   These are specific asset lists curated by the Santiment Team based on various aspects of the assets, such as `Stablecoins`. If you have any feedback or believe we might be missing tokens in any of these categories, please feel free to get in touch with us.

2. **`Watchlists`**

   These are similar to **Categories**, but the key difference is that they can be created by any user.

## Available Categories

- **`All Assets`**: This category contains all tokens we track across various blockchains.
- **`ERC 20`**: This category exclusively displays Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens.
- **`Top 50 ERC20`**: This is a dynamic category that showcases the 50 most prominent ERC20 projects we track.
- **`Stablecoins`**: This is a curated list of assets that are intended to maintain a fixed value.
- **`Decentralized Exchanges`**: This category contains a curated list of decentralized exchanges and their utility tokens.
- **`Centralized Exchanges`**: This category features a curated list of regular exchanges and their utility tokens.
- **`Emerging Trending Assets`**: This is a dynamic category with assets that are currently trending in our [**_Emerging Trends_**](/sanbase/emerging-trends-page).

Each category page contains a table similar to the one found on the **_Watchlist page_**, but the list of assets cannot be modified.
