title: How to Request New Token Coverage
author: Santiment Team

At Santiment, we work directly with on-chain data, which allows us to display information about any token whose contract address is known. However, due to the high volume of tokens available, we have chosen to only make a curated and continuously expanding list of tokens searchable on Sanbase.

To request the addition of a new token to Sanbase, or to add a known team wallet containing significant assets held by the team, please send us a message via

- [Discord](https://santiment.net/discord), via the feature request channel
- [Telegram](https://t.me/santiment_network)
- The green "help and feedback button" on app.santiment.net
