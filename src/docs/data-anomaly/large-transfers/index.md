## Definition

**Large Transfers** signal is triggered when a significant non-DEX and non-CEX transfer occurs for a particular token. This alert activates when a transfer in USD value exceeds the top-10th largest transfer in the last two weeks for that token.
This signal is essential for monitoring whale movements, tracking large holder activity, and detecting potential strategic shifts in the market.
