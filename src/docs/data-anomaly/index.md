The crypto market is noisy by the minute. We keep it simple: we surface meaningful anomalies from on-chain activity, social signals, and derivatives microstructure, and turn them into clear, ready-to-use signals. 

Unlike traditional dashboards, we focus on actionability and reliability. Every signal is validated with rigorous statistical tests and out-of-sample checks to reduce false positives. Integrate notifications to fit your workflow—use the actionable anomalies in a way you like.

If you’re looking for a systematic way to improve decision quality in a complex market, Data Anomaly is the simplest place to start.
