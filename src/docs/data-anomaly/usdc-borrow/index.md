## Definition

**USDC Borrow** signal monitors significant changes in the total amount of USDC borrowed across major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This signal is calculated by summing the USDC borrowed in AAVE and Compound, providing insight into the market's borrowing behavior and liquidity dynamics.

**USDC Borrow** represents the aggregated value of USDC that market participants are borrowing on these platforms. An increase in borrowing can indicate rising demand for liquidity, increased leveraging, or bullish market sentiment, whereas a decrease might suggest a more cautious approach or reduced market activity.
