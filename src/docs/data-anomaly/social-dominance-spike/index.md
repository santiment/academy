## Definition

**Social Dominance Spike** signal identifies abnormal spikes in social dominance metrics for cryptocurrency assets using statistical z-score analysis. It monitors pre-calculated z-scores from social data and detects when assets experience unusually high or low levels of social attention compared to their historical patterns.

The signal processes z-score values that represent how many standard deviations an asset's current social dominance deviates from its historical average, triggering alerts when these values exceed statistical significance thresholds (default: 3.0 standard deviations).
