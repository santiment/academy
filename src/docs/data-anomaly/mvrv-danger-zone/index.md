## Definition

**MVRV Danger (Overvaluation) Zone** signal is triggered when the MVRV metric suggests that the asset is overvalued, indicating a potential risk of market correction. This signal activates when the current MVRV value exceeds the upper threshold based on historical MVRV spikes over recent time. It helps investors assess when the market may be becoming over-leveraged, signaling a heightened risk of asset overvaluation.
