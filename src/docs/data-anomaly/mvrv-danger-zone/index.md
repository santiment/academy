## Definition

**MVRV Danger (Overvaluation) Zone** anomaly is triggered when the MVRV metric suggests that the asset is overvalued, indicating a potential risk of market correction. This anomaly activates when the current MVRV value exceeds the upper threshold based on historical MVRV spikes over recent time. It helps investors assess when the market may be becoming over-leveraged, signaling a heightened risk of asset overvaluation.

## Use Cases

- MVRV can help institutional investors gauge market liquidity and risk exposure. Spikes in MVRV ratios can indicate that the market is becoming over-leveraged, while dips may signal safer entry points.
- Long-term investors can use MVRV to track market cycles and identify when it might be wise to enter or exit positions.
- The MVRV Danger Zone Data Anomaly becomes even more powerful when used in conjunction with the [MVRV Opportunity (Undervaluation) Zone](/data-anomaly/mvrv-opportunity-zone) Data Anomaly. While the Opportunity Data Anomaly identifies undervaluation and potential accumulation points, the Danger Anomaly warns of potential overvaluation and the risk of a price correction. By leveraging both anomalies, you can strategically time their entry and exit points.
