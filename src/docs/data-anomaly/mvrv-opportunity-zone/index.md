## Definition

**MVRV Opportunity (Undervaluation) Zone** signal is triggered when the MVRV metric indicates that the asset is undervalued, signaling a favorable entry point for long-term investors. This signal activates when the current MVRV value falls below the lower threshold based on historical MVRV dips over the recent period, highlighting potential accumulation opportunities.
